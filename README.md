# Java-Theory
A complete Java learning repository covering basics to advanced topics including OOP, data structures, GUI, and database connectivity. Perfect for beginners and developers to explore Java with clear examples and structured modules for hands-on learning.

## ðŸ”¹ Basics
### ðŸ”¹ 1_HelloWorld.java
The **HelloWorld.java** program is the simplest Java application that introduces the basic structure of a Java program. It contains a class, a `main` method, and a print statement.

This program uses `System.out.println` to display text on the console, making it the first step in understanding Java syntax and execution. It helps beginners get familiar with how Java programs are written and run.

### ðŸ”¹2_CommandLineArguments.java
The **CommandLineArguments.java** program demonstrates how to pass and handle command-line arguments in Java. Command-line arguments are values provided when executing the program from the terminal or command prompt.

This program takes arguments as an array (`args[]`), iterates through them using a loop, and prints each argument to the console. It is useful for handling user inputs without requiring interactive input during runtime.

### ðŸ”¹3_SingleAndMultiLineComments.java
This program demonstrates how to use single-line and multi-line comments in Java.

- **Single-line comments** are used to comment out a single line of code. They begin with `//` and everything after `//` on that line is treated as a comment.  
  In the example, `// THIS IS SINGLE LINE COMMENTS` is a single-line comment.

- **Multi-line comments** are used to comment out multiple lines of code. They begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.  
  In the example, `/* THIS PART IS ALLOCATED FOR MULTI LINE COMMENTS */` is a multi-line comment that can span multiple lines.

#### ðŸ”¹ Types of Type Casting:
1. **Widening Casting (Automatic Type Conversion)**
- Converts a smaller data type into a larger one automatically.
- Order: `byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double`
- Example: Converting an `int` to a `double`.

2. **Narrowing Casting (Explicit Type Conversion)**
- Converts a larger data type into a smaller one manually using type casting.
- Order: `double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte`
- Example: Converting a `double` to an `int`.

#### ðŸ”¹ Program Functionality:
- Demonstrates **widening casting** by converting an `int` to a `double`.
- Demonstrates **narrowing casting** by converting a `double` to an `int`.
- Prints the original and converted values to the console.

This program helps in understanding how type conversion works in Java and when to use explicit or implicit casting.
