### ðŸ”¹L13_ScannerClassExample.java
This program demonstrates how to use the **`Scanner`** class in Java to obtain input from the user and perform a simple mathematical calculation with **floating-point numbers**.

#### ðŸ”¹Scanner Methods Used:
- **`scanner.nextFloat()`**: This method is used to read floating-point numbers from the user.
- Other common methods include **`nextInt()`**, **`nextDouble()`**, **`nextLine()`**, and **`next()`**, which are used to read different data types and strings.

#### ðŸ”¹Scanner Class Methods Overview:
- **`nextInt()`**: Reads an integer input.
- **`nextDouble()`**: Reads a double input.
- **`nextLine()`**: Reads an entire line of input as a string.
- **`next()`**: Reads the next token (word) as a string.
- **`hasNext()`**: Checks if there is another token to read.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **Creating a Scanner object**: `Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);` allows the program to get input from the user.
- **Mathematical Calculation**: The formula `(a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab` is used here to demonstrate how floating-point arithmetic works.
- **Closing the Scanner**: Itâ€™s important to call `scanner.close()` when done to release the resources.

#### ðŸ”¹Other Usage of Scanner Class:
- `Scanner` can be used to read input not only from the console but also from other sources like files or strings.
- Itâ€™s useful for parsing various types of data, such as numbers, strings, and lines of text.

This program is a simple illustration of reading input, performing a calculation, and outputting the result in Java.

## ðŸ”¹p02_Control Structures
### ðŸ”¹L14_IFStatement.java
This program demonstrates the use of the **`if`** statement in Java to check a condition and execute a block of code based on the result.

#### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts:
- **`if` Statement**:  
  The `if` statement checks whether a given condition is true. If the condition is true, the code block inside the `if` statement executes.

- **`Scanner` Class**:  
  The program uses the `Scanner` class to take input from the user, which is stored in the `age` variable.

#### ðŸ”¹ Additional Notes:
- If the user enters an age less than 18, the program does not print anything, as there is no `else` clause.
- **`Scanner` class methods** like `nextInt()` are used to read numerical input.
- The program could be extended with an `else` statement to provide feedback for users who are under 18.

This program is a basic demonstration of how the **`if`** statement can be used to check conditions and control the flow of a program.

### .....................................................

### ðŸ”¹L15_IFELSEStatement.java
This program demonstrates how to use the **`if-else`** statement in Java for conditional logic. The primary goal of the program is to determine whether a given year is a **leap year** or not, based on the Gregorian calendar rules.

#### ðŸ”¹ Key Concepts:
- **Leap Year Logic**:  
  A **leap year** is defined as:
  - A year that is divisible by **4**, but not divisible by **100**, unless it is also divisible by **400**. This rule ensures that the leap year calculation accounts for the additional day in February once every four years, except for centuries that are not divisible by 400.

- **Using `if-else`**:  
  The `if-else` statement is employed to execute one block of code when a condition is true and another when the condition is false. In this program, the `if` block checks whether the year satisfies the leap year conditions, and the `else` block handles the case where the year does not meet the criteria for being a leap year.

- **User Input**:  
  The program utilizes the **`Scanner` class** to gather input from the user. This allows the user to enter the year they wish to evaluate, making the program dynamic and interactive.

#### ðŸ”¹Importance of Conditional Logic:
- Conditional statements like **`if-else`** help control the flow of a program based on whether specific conditions are true or false. This makes it possible to create programs that can adapt to different inputs or situations, such as determining if a year is a leap year or not.

- The program highlights how basic control structures like **`if-else`** can be used in a practical scenario (e.g., leap year determination), showing their usefulness in day-to-day programming tasks.

### ðŸ”¹L16_ELSEIFLadder.java
This program demonstrates the use of the **`else-if`** ladder in Java to assign grades based on a student's average marks.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **`else-if` Ladder**:  
  The `else-if` ladder is used when there are multiple conditions to check in a sequence. The program checks each condition one by one, starting from the first `if` and then moving through the `else-if` statements until one of the conditions evaluates to true. If none of the conditions are true, the final `else` block executes.

- **Conditional Grade Assignment**:  
  Based on the student's average marks (input by the user), the program assigns a grade. The conditions are as follows:
  - **Grade A**: For marks between **90** and **100**.
  - **Grade B**: For marks between **80** and **89**.
  - **Grade C**: For marks between **70** and **79**.
  - **Grade D**: For marks between **60** and **69**.
  - **Grade E**: For marks below **60**.

- **User Input**:  
  The program uses the **`Scanner`** class to take input from the user for the average marks, allowing for dynamic input during execution.

- **Flow Control**:  
  The `else-if` ladder helps streamline the process of checking multiple conditions and performing actions based on each possible outcome, making the code more readable and efficient when handling several related conditions.

This program is an example of how **`else-if`** structures are helpful for handling multiple conditions in a clear and structured manner.

### .....................................................

### ðŸ”¹L17_NestedIfExample.java
This program demonstrates the use of **nested `if`** statements in Java. It checks a person's eligibility for insurance based on their marital status, gender, and age.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **Nested `if` Statements**:  
  A **nested `if`** statement occurs when one `if` statement is placed inside another. This allows for more complex decision-making, as the program first checks a primary condition and then evaluates additional conditions inside the first block.

- **Marital Status Check**:  
  The program first checks if the person is unmarried (`U` or `u`) or married (`M` or `m`).
  - If unmarried, the program asks for gender and age to determine eligibility for insurance.
  - If married, the program directly determines eligibility without checking gender or age.

- **Eligibility Criteria**:
  - **Unmarried Males**: Eligible for insurance if their age is **30 or older**.
  - **Unmarried Females**: Eligible for insurance if their age is **25 or older**.
  - **Married Individuals**: Always eligible for insurance, regardless of gender or age.

- **User Input**:  
  The program uses **`Scanner`** to get inputs for marital status, gender, and age from the user, which are then processed to decide if the person is eligible for insurance.

- **Flow Control**:  
  The program demonstrates how complex decisions can be made by nesting `if` statements to check multiple conditions before arriving at a final conclusion.

This program shows how **nested `if` statements** allow for multiple layers of decision-making based on different factors.

### .....................................................

### ðŸ”¹L18_SwitchStatement.java
This program demonstrates the use of the **`switch`** statement in Java, a control structure that allows for multi-way branching based on a variable's value.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **Switch Statement**:  
  The `switch` statement is used to execute one of many code blocks based on the value of a variable. It compares the value of the variable (in this case, `choice`) to different `case` labels, and executes the code associated with the matching `case`.

- **Basic Operations**:  
  The program allows the user to choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) by entering a number from the menu (1-4). After the user selects an operation, the program prompts them to input two numbers, and then performs the corresponding arithmetic operation.

- **Case Labels**:
  - **Case 1**: Performs **addition** of two numbers.
  - **Case 2**: Performs **subtraction** of two numbers.
  - **Case 3**: Performs **multiplication** of two numbers.
  - **Case 4**: Performs **division** of two numbers.
  - **Default Case**: If the user enters a number that is not between 1 and 4, it prints `"Invalid Selection"`.

- **Break Statement**:  
  The `break` statement is used to terminate the `switch` block once a case is executed. Without it, the program would continue checking the remaining cases, leading to undesired results.

- **User Input**:  
  The program uses **`Scanner`** to take user input for both the operation choice and the numbers to perform calculations on.

- **Error Handling**:  
  Although this program handles invalid choices via the default case, there is no explicit handling for **division by zero**, which could cause an error if the user enters zero when performing the division operation.

This program highlights how a **`switch` statement** simplifies decision-making when there are multiple choices based on a single variable, making the code cleaner and easier to read.

### .....................................................

### ðŸ”¹L19_GroupSwitchStatement.java
This program demonstrates the use of **grouped `case` labels** within a `switch` statement in Java. It checks whether a given character is a vowel or not.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **Grouped `case` Labels**:  
  In a `switch` statement, multiple `case` labels can be grouped together to execute the same block of code for different values. In this case, the vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) are grouped together to print that the character is a vowel.

- **Switch Statement**:  
  The `switch` statement is used to evaluate a variable (`c`) and compare it against multiple `case` labels. If a match is found, the code under the corresponding `case` label is executed.

- **Vowels Check**:  
  The program checks if the entered character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase) by using the grouped `case` labels. If the character is a vowel, it prints the message indicating the character is a vowel. If the character is not a vowel, it falls to the `default` case and prints that the character is not a vowel.

- **Break Statement**:  
  Each `case` group ends with a `break` statement to ensure the switch statement exits once a match is found and the corresponding code is executed.

- **User Input**:  
  The program uses **`Scanner`** to take user input for a character and then checks whether the character is a vowel.

- **Default Case**:  
  The `default` case handles the situation where the entered character is not a vowel and prints an appropriate message.

This program shows how **grouped `case` labels** in a `switch` statement can simplify code when multiple values need to trigger the same behavior.

### .....................................................

## ðŸ”¹p03_Loops
### ðŸ”¹L20_WhileLoop.java
This program demonstrates the use of a **while loop** in Java. It repeatedly prints numbers from 1 up to a user-defined limit.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **While Loop**:  
  A **while loop** repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. In this case, the loop continues to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to the `limit` provided by the user.

- **Condition Checking**:  
  The loop starts by checking if the condition `i <= limit` is true. If true, the block of code inside the loop is executed. After each iteration, the value of `i` is incremented (`i++`) to ensure progress towards meeting the exit condition.

- **User Input**:  
  The program uses the `Scanner` class to take an integer input (`limit`) from the user, which determines how many times the loop will run.

- **Output**:  
  The program prints numbers starting from 1 up to the value of `limit`. The numbers are printed one by one on each iteration of the loop.

- **Exit Condition**:  
  Once `i` exceeds the `limit`, the loop condition becomes false (`i > limit`), causing the loop to stop executing.

This program illustrates how a **while loop** can be used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly based on a dynamic condition.

### .....................................................

### ðŸ”¹L21_DoWhileLoop.java
This program demonstrates the use of a **do-while loop** in Java. It prints even numbers starting from 2 up to a user-defined limit.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **Do-While Loop**:  
  A **do-while loop** is similar to a **while loop**, but with a key difference: the block of code inside the `do` section is executed at least once, even if the condition is false at the first check. After executing the block once, it checks the condition in the `while` part. If the condition is true, it will repeat the loop. This ensures the loop runs at least once.

- **Condition Checking**:  
  In this case, the loop continues to execute as long as the condition `i <= limit` holds true. The value of `i` starts at 2, and it is incremented by 2 in each iteration (to print even numbers only). The loop will stop when `i` exceeds the user-defined `limit`.

- **User Input**:  
  The program takes an integer input (`limit`) from the user, which specifies the upper bound for the loop. The user decides how many even numbers they want to print.

- **Output**:  
  The program prints even numbers starting from 2 up to the specified limit. The loop continues to print numbers until the condition `i <= limit` becomes false.

- **Exit Condition**:  
  When `i` becomes greater than the `limit`, the loop terminates, and no further numbers are printed.

This program showcases the use of a **do-while loop** to handle situations where you want to execute a block of code at least once, regardless of the condition, and then repeatedly execute it while a condition is true.

### .....................................................

### ðŸ”¹L22_ForLoop.java
This program demonstrates the use of a **for loop** in Java. It prints numbers from 1 to a user-defined limit.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **For Loop**:  
  The **for loop** is a control structure that allows you to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times. It consists of three parts:
  1. **Initialization**: The loop counter (`i`) is initialized (in this case, `i = 1`).
  2. **Condition**: The loop runs as long as the condition (`i <= limit`) is true.
  3. **Increment**: After each iteration, the loop counter is incremented (`i++`).

- **User Input**:  
  The program takes an integer input (`limit`) from the user, which specifies the number of iterations the loop should run.

- **Output**:  
  The program prints the numbers starting from 1 up to the specified `limit`. Each number is printed on a new line.

- **Exit Condition**:  
  The loop stops when the value of `i` exceeds the `limit`, which causes the condition `i <= limit` to become false.

This program demonstrates the use of a **for loop** to execute a block of code a set number of times, making it ideal for situations where the number of iterations is known beforehand.

### .....................................................

### ðŸ”¹L23_EnhancedForLoop.java
This program demonstrates the use of an **enhanced for loop** (also known as the **foreach loop**) in Java to iterate through an array.

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **Enhanced For Loop**:  
  The **enhanced for loop** simplifies the iteration over arrays or collections. Instead of using a traditional `for` loop with an index, it directly accesses each element in the array or collection. In this case, the loop iterates over the `numbers` array.

### .....................................................

### ðŸ”¹L24_NestedForLoop.java
This program demonstrates the use of a **nested for loop** in Java to print a pattern of asterisks (`*`).

#### ðŸ”¹Key Concepts:
- **Nested For Loop**:  
  A **nested for loop** refers to placing one `for` loop inside another. The outer loop controls the number of rows, and the inner loop controls the number of columns or elements printed in each row. In this program, the outer loop controls the number of lines, and the inner loop controls the number of asterisks printed in each line.

### .....................................................

## ðŸ”¹L25_BreakAndContinue.java
### `break` Statement:
- Immediately **exits the loop** when a condition is met.
- The remaining iterations are skipped.

### `continue` Statement:
- **Skips the current iteration** and moves to the next one.
- The loop continues executing normally.

### Example Behavior:
- `break` stops the loop early.
- `continue` skips specific iterations but keeps the loop running.

### .....................................................

- Average is calculated using `sum / n`.

### .....................................................

## ðŸ”¹ L28_FibonacciSeries.java

### âœ¨ Summary:
- Prints the first `n` numbers of the **Fibonacci series**.
- Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Points:
- Takes a number `n` as input using `Scanner`.
- Uses a `for` loop to generate and print the Fibonacci sequence.
- Starts with `a = -1` and `b = 1` so the first term becomes `0`.
